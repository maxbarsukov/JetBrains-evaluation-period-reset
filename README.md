# JetBrains-evaluation-period-reset
These scripts allow you to easily and simply reset the evaluation period of JetBrains products

## Usage example

You can run the files as you want, for example:

Linux:

```sh
bash idea-reset-lin.sh
```

Windows:

```sh
idea-reset-lin.bat
```

## Note

As you can see, all files have a similar structure, so you can safely modify them for other JetBrains products by changing few words and it will probably work!
